# Dhamma Mirror

> A wise friend for difficult moments

**Before you send that email. Before you make that decision. Before you say something you can't take back.**

Ask the mirror.

---

## What is this?

It's 11pm. You're furious. You're drafting the email in your head. Every word is justified.

Or: You're grieving. You're thinking about quitting, moving, ending things. It feels right.

Or: You're overwhelmed. You can't think straight. But you need to decide. Now.

**Here's the problem:** When you're angry, sad, or overwhelmed, you can't see clearly. The emotion shapes what you see. And decisions made in that state often lead to regret.

**Dhamma Mirror** helps you pause. It asks questions — not gives advice — so you can see what the emotion is hiding. Then you decide. From clarity, not reaction.

No. If you're struggling with mental health, please see a professional. This is a reflection tool, not treatment.

## The Goal

When you use Dhamma Mirror, you should feel:

> "I see something I couldn't see before."

Not "I got good advice."  
Not "I feel better."  

The seeing is the point.  
Everything else follows from there.

*Sabbē sattā sukhī hontu*  
**May all beings be happy.**
