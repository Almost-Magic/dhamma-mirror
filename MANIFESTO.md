# The Dhamma Mirror Manifesto

## What This Is

Dhamma Mirror is a pause made visible.

It exists because sometimes, at 11pm, you're about to send an email you'll regret.
Or make a decision while grieving. Or say something you can't take back.

In those moments, you don't need advice.
You need a mirror.

## Our Principles

### 1. We Don't Fix

We don't try to make you feel better.
We don't try to solve your problem.
We don't try to optimise your emotions.

We help you see clearly. That's all.

### 2. We Don't Advise

We will never tell you what to do.
We will only ask questions.
The answers are yours to find.

### 3. We Don't Replace People

Dhamma Mirror is not a therapist.
It's not a teacher.
It's not a friend.

It's a tool that helps you see.
Then you take what you've seen to the people who matter.

### 4. We Slow Things Down

In a world that rewards speed,
we protect the pause.

Sometimes the wisest action is no action.
We make space for that.

### 5. We Trust the User

You are not broken.
You don't need fixing.
You don't need us.

You just need a moment of clarity.
We offer that moment.

### 6. Seeing Is Enough

We don't track your progress.
We don't gamify your growth.
We don't measure your improvement.

If you see something you couldn't see before,
that's enough.

## The Foundation

Dhamma Mirror is grounded in the Buddha's teaching — specifically the Vipassana tradition as taught by S.N. Goenka in the lineage of Sayagyi U Ba Khin.

But you don't need to be Buddhist to use it.
You don't need to meditate.
You just need to be human.

The wisdom is universal:
- **Don't act when angry** — every tradition teaches this
- **Your body knows before your mind admits** — somatic awareness
- **Questions reveal more than answers** — Socratic method
- **Wait for clarity** — patience as wisdom

For those who want to go deeper, the suttas are there.
For those who just need help in a moment, the questions are enough.

## What This Means for Contributors

If you want to contribute to Dhamma Mirror:

### Do:
- Ask questions that help people see
- Create space and silence
- Trust the user's intelligence
- Point toward human support
- Protect the pause
- Direct users to authoritative sources (dhamma.org, qualified teachers)

### Don't:
- Give advice (ever)
- Add gamification (ever)
- Track "progress" (ever)
- Optimise engagement (ever)
- Replace the need for human connection
- Claim to teach meditation technique

### The Test

Before adding anything, ask:

> "Does this help someone see more clearly?"

If yes, consider it.
If no, don't add it.
If "it helps them feel better" — that's not our job.

---

## The Goal

When someone uses Dhamma Mirror, they should feel:

> "I see something I couldn't see before."

Not:
- "I got good advice."
- "I feel better."
- "The app helped me."

The seeing is the point.
Everything else follows from there.

---

## A Note on Technology

Dhamma Mirror uses AI. But the AI is not the point.

The AI is a mirror.
Mirrors don't have wisdom.
They reflect.

The wisdom is in you.
We just help you see it.

---

## A Note on Tradition

We respect the teaching.

- We don't claim authority we don't have
- We don't teach technique (attend a course for that)
- We don't reproduce copyrighted discourses
- We direct users to official resources (dhamma.org)
- We clearly state we are independent, not affiliated with VRI

The Dhamma has been freely available for 2,500 years.
We're just making it accessible in a new way.

---

## A Note on Commerce

Dhamma Mirror is free. Forever.

- No subscriptions
- No premium features
- No data harvesting
- No ads

In the Buddhist tradition, this is called **dāna** — generosity.

The teaching was given freely.
We pass it on freely.

---

## The Sacred No's

These are things we will never do, regardless of user requests or business pressure:

- ❌ **Never gamify** — No streaks, points, badges, levels, achievements
- ❌ **Never track engagement** — No metrics on "time in app" or "sessions"
- ❌ **Never add social features** — No sharing, following, comparing
- ❌ **Never send notifications** — You come to us; we don't chase you
- ❌ **Never claim spiritual authority** — We're a mirror, not a guru
- ❌ **Never replace human connection** — We supplement; we don't substitute
- ❌ **Never sell data** — Your reflections are yours alone
- ❌ **Never add ads** — The pause is sacred; we don't interrupt it

---

## The Essential Yes's

These are commitments we make:

- ✅ **Always free** — Dana, not commerce
- ✅ **Always private** — Your data stays on your device
- ✅ **Always open source** — Verify everything yourself
- ✅ **Always humble** — We know our limits
- ✅ **Always point to teachers** — Human guidance matters
- ✅ **Always respect the tradition** — We honour our sources
- ✅ **Always ask, never tell** — Questions, not answers
- ✅ **Always prioritise safety** — Crisis resources always visible

## For Future Maintainers

If you're maintaining this project after its creator has moved on:

1. **Read this manifesto first** — before changing anything
2. **Ask: "Does this help someone see?"** — before adding features
3. **Protect the pause** — resist the urge to add more
4. **Stay humble** — this is a mirror, not a teacher
5. **Keep it free** — the teaching should remain accessible
6. **Respect the tradition** — direct users to proper sources

The best version of Dhamma Mirror is probably simpler than you think.

Resist the urge to add.
The restraint is the product.

---

## Closing

Dhamma Mirror is not a self-help app.
It is a pause made visible.

Its value lies in:
- Restraint
- Humility
- Trust in the user's own seeing

If you're reading this, you're part of protecting that.

Thank you.
